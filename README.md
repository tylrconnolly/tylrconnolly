Hi, I am Tyler. 
I have begun the path of self learning at the beginnning of 2021. 
My motivation to start learning how to write code is to make a career transition over 
  the next year into a role where I can apply these newly learned skills. 
I am currently learning: HTML, CSS, Javascript, C# and Python. Ideally I would love to work in backend development but I want to learn various languages to use for my personal use in building my brand, TC Studios. 
You can reach me at tylermcon15@gmail.com
