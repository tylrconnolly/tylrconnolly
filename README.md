Hi, I am Tyler. 
I am new to coding and have begun a path of self learning at the beginnning of 2021. 
My motivation to start learning how to write code is to make a career transition over 
  the next year into a role where I can apply these newly learned skills. 
I am currently learning: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
